**XQDebug** is a browser-based debugger for _MarkLogic_ XQuery applications.  It is useful for debugging native XQuery applications, RESTful web services and XQuery code in general.

Once you have installed XQDebug on a MarkLogic host, you can connect to any of that host's MarkLogic application servers which will stop all requests to that appserver for debugging.  Then from the main XQDebug window you can select the stopped request to debug, view the current expression and variables, view the call stack, set breakpoints, create watch expressions and step through your XQuery code.

XQDebug has been tested on MarkLogic 4.1-5+ from FireFox 3.6+, Chrome 18+ and IE 8.0+.

The Google Group XQDebug (xqdebug@googlegroups.com)has been setup for announcements of versions, fixes and updates.  Anyone can join the group.

If you have questions about installing or using the debugger send email to general@developer.marklogic.com .
