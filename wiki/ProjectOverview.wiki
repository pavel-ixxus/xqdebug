== Project Overview: ==
The goal of the XQDebug Project is to provide a Browser based debugger that is independent of any editor or browser, that can be installed and available for developers and administrators to develop and debug applications.

XQDebug uses the MarkLogic debugging (dbg) API as much as possible to accomplish debugging tasks. Where the dbg library does not yet provide functionality, or we encounter bugs, we may need to create workarounds until a fix or update is available.

XQDebug must run from and write to a database that is independent of any application or XQuery code that it is debugging. Otherwise it is possible to introduce changes in the state of the application that is being debugged. Therefore the install must create a database named XQDebug and copy all code and write all persisted information to that database.
